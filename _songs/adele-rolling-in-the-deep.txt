[Intro]
C5
 
[Verse 1]
C5               G5
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Bb5                                G5                 Bb5
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
C5              G5
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Bb5                           G5                 Bb5
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
 
C5                     G5
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Bb5                       G5                  Bb5
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
C5                G5
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Bb5                                G5                   Bb5
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ab               Bb                      Gm
    The scars of your love, remind me of us.
               Ab                           Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             Bb                        Gm
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
              G
I can't help feeling...
 
[Chorus]
                     Cm                              Bb
We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
                Ab
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
      Bb                                          Cm           Bb
You had my heart... (You're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           Ab                                                                   Bb
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
 
[Verse 2]
C5                G5
Baby, I have no story to be told,
Bb5                                G5                  Bb5
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
C5                   G5
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Bb5                          G5                  Bb5
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ab               Bb                      Gm
    The scars of your love, remind me of us.
               Ab                           Ab
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             Bb                        Gm
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
              G
I can't help feeling...
 
[Chorus]
                     Cm                              Bb
We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...

Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
      Bb                                          Cm           Bb
You had my heart... (You're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           Ab                                                                   Bb
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
                      Ab       Bb
We could have had it all
                 Cm       Bb
Rolling in the deep
                   Ab
You had my heart inside of your hand
         Bb
And you played it with a beating
 
[Verse 3]
N.C.
Throw your soul through every open door (Whoa)
N.C.
Count your blessings to find what look for (Whoa-uh)
C5
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
C5
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.

You played it to the beat.
