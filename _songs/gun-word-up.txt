[Verse]
F#                E
Yoh pretty ladies around the world
D                    E
Got a wierd thing to show you
        F#
So tell all the boys and girls
F#                                 E
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too
      D           E
We're about to go down
        F#
And you know just what to do
F#                              E
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
      D        E              F#
Glide past the people as they stop to look and stare
   F#                         E
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick oh mamma
D        E            F#
 Come on baby tell me what's the word
 
[Chorus]
       F#     E
Word up, everybody say
D                 E                 F#
When you hear the call you've gotta get it underway
       F#         E
Word up, it's the code word
   D                E          F#
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard
 
[Verse]
Now you sucker DJ's that think you're fly
There's gotta be a reason and you know the reason why
Why you put on your airs and you act real cool
Got to realise that you're acting like fools
Now there's music we can use it you're free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me and mamma
 Come on baby tell me what's the word
 
[Chorus]
 
[Solo]
