[Verse 3]
Yet, in my mind I say "If he makes his move today  I'll just pretend to be shocked"
Oh baby, it's a tragedy, that you and me we don't even try
 
[Chorus]
You're as much to blame
'Cause I know you feel the same
I can see it in your eyes
But I've got no time to live this lie
No, I've got no time to play your silly ga----------mes

Silly ga-----------mes
Silly ga-----------mes
Silly ga-----------mes
