## How It Works

All the backing videos are mixed in 5.1 surround sound, using instrumental tracks and videos provided by [karaoke-version.co.uk](https://www.karaoke-version.co.uk/). The ‘backing’ mix (drums, keyboards, strings, piano) is assigned to the back left and right channels, and each guitar is on a separate channel in the 5.1 mix – lead on the left, bass in the middle, rhythm on the right. The sound runs from the laptop into an Asus XONAR 5.1 audio interface, which gives isolated outputs for each track. Each track runs into a separate channel on the desk, so we can turn individual instruments on/off depending who’s playing what on the night.
