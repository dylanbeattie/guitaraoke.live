[Verse 1]
Em                             D
They told him, Don't you ever come around here.
       Em		               D
Don't wanna see your face, You better disappear
        C                           D
The fires in their eyes and their words are really clear
     Em	            D
So beat it   Just beat it

Em		            D
You better run	You better do what you can
       Em		              D
Don't wanna see no blood  Don't be a macho man
        C	               D
You wanna be tough  Better do what you can
     Em	             D
So beat it  But you wanna be bad
 
[Chorus]
Em		     D
Just beat (beat it)  Beat it (Beat it)
Em                         D
No one wants to be defeated
Em                         D
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
   Em                   D
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
        Em             D
Just beat it   Just beat it
        Em            D
Just beat it  Just beat it
 
[Verse 2]
Em		                  D
They're out to get you Better leave while you can
           Em	                D
Don't wanna be a boy  You wanna be a man
        C	              D
You wanna stay alive  Better do what you can
      Em             D
So beat it   Just beat it

Em                                  D
You have to show them that you're really not scared
        Em
You're playin' with your life
              D
This ain't no truth or dare
             C                                      D
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you its fair
      Em                 D
So beat it     But you wanna be bad
 
[Chorus]
