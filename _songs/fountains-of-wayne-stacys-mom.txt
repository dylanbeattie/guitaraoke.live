[Intro] x2
E A B A
 
E        A       B           A
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on  x4
 
[Verse]
E       A         B    A        E  A B A
 Stacy can I come over after school?
E        A     B            A  E A B A
 we can hang around by the pool
E          A       B             A         E A B A
 did your mom get back from the business trip?
E         A      B                 A            E A B A
 is she there or is she trying to give me the slip? 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
              G#m                      A
You know I'm not the little boy that I used to be
    G#m               A
I'm all grown up now baby can't you see?
 
[Chorus]
A        E       B           C#m
Stacy's mom has got it goin' on
      A      E             B             C#m
she's all I want and I've waited for so long
A                E               Co(or G#7)    C#m
Stacy can't you see you're just not the girl for me
    A                        B
I know it might be wrong but I'm in love with Stacy's...
 
[Post Chorus] x2
E         A       B           A
 Stacy's mom has got it goin' on  ...mom
 
[Verse]
E       A        B             A          E A B A
 Stacy do you remember when I mowed your lawn
E              A  B             A    E A B A
 your mom came out with just a towel on
E         A        B                 A        E    A B A
 I could tell she likes me from the way she stared
E         A           B                A         E   A B A
 and the way she said: "you missed a spot over there"
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        G#m                            A
And I know that you think it's just a fantasy
     G#m                                     A
but since your dad walked out your mom could use a guy like me
 
[Chorus]

C  G  D  Em  / C  G  B7 B7 / C  G  D  Em / C  C  B7 B7

[Chorus x 2]
