[Intro]
Am B E F G
 
[Verse 1]
Am		     B
I think I'm drowning asphyxiated
E			 F               G  
I wanna break this spell  that you've created
Am			    B
you're something beautiful  a contradiction
E		      F           G
I wanna play the game I want the friction

Am       B      E         F    G
you will be the death of me
Am       B      E         F    G
you will be the death of me
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
F	 G               Am           G
bury it	 I won't let you bury it
                 F	    G               Am           G
I won't let you smother it  I won't let you murder it
 
[Chorus 1]
            F		G            Am            C
our time is running out	  our time is running out
                  F	      G                  Am            F G
you can't push it underground   you can't stop it screaming out
 
[Break 1]
Am B E F G
 
[Verse 2]
Am		 B
I wanted freedom bound and restricted
E		       F         G
I tried to give you up but I'm addicted
Am			       B
now that you know I'm trapped  sense of elation
E		      F         G
you'd never dream of  breaking this fixation 
Am        B          E           F    G
you will squeeze the life out of me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
