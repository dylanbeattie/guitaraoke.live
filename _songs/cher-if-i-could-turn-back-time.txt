[Intro]
B       Bsus4 B      x2
 
 
[Pre-verse]
           B              Bsus4 B
If I could turn back time
           E          Esus4 E
If I could find a way
         C#m                                       F#
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay
 
 
[Verse 1]
F#            B             E        F#
I don't know why I did the things I did
F#            B              E        F#
I don't know why I said the things I said
F#              B             E          F#
Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
F#              B             E         F#
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
E G#m F#                        E      G#m F#
        I didn't really mean to hurt you
                       E
I didn't wanna see you go
                    F#
I know I made you cry, but baby
 
 
[Chorus]
           B              Bsus4 B
If I could turn back time
           E          Esus4 E
If I could find a way
         C#m                                       F#
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay
           B               Bsus4 B
If I could reach the stars
             E          Esus4 E
I'd give 'em all to you
           C#m                                F#  B   E
Then you'd love me, love me like you used to do
           F#
If I could turn back time
 
 
[Verse 2]
F#            B                E     F#
My world was shattered, I was torn apart
F#                 B                    E       F#
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
F#                   B                      E        F#
When you walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
      F#
But I lost everything darling, then and there
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
E G#m F#                            E    G#m F#
        Too strong to tell you I was sorry
                            E
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
                      F#
And I know that I was blind, and darling
 
 
[Chorus]
           B              Bsus4 B
If I could turn back time
           E          Esus4 E
If I could find a way
         C#m                                       F#
I'd take back those words that hurt you and you'd stay
           B               Bsus4 B
If I could reach the stars
             E          Esus4 E
I'd give 'em all to you
           C#m                                F#
Then you'd love me, love me like you used to do
 
 
[Bridge]
F#  B   E           F#
        If I could turn back time (If I could turn back time)
F#  B   E          F#
        If I could turn back time (If I could turn back time)
F#  B   E          F#
        If I could turn back time (If I could turn back time)
F#  B   E   F#   F#  B   E E  F# F#
        Oh! Baby!
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
E G#m F#                        E      G#m F#
        I didn't really mean to hurt you
                       E
I didn't wanna see you go
                    F#
I know I made you cry
 
 
[Chorus]
           B              Bsus4 B
If I could turn back time
           E          Esus4 E
If I could find a way
         C#m
I'd take back those words that hurt you
           D               Dsus4 D
If I could reach the stars
             G          Gsus4  G
I'd give 'em all to you
           Em                                A
Then you'd love me, love me like you used to do
           D              Dsus4 D
If I could turn back time
           G          Gsus4  G
If I could find a way
