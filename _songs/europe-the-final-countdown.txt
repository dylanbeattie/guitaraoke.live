[Verse]
F#m			                    Bm
    We're leaving together, But still it's farewell
F#m			          E/G#     A
    And maybe we'll come back, To earth, who can tell?
D                  E		  A       E/G#    F#m      E       D
  I guess there is no one to blame  We're leaving ground  (leaving ground)
                 C#m           E
Will things ever be the same again?

[Chorus]
               F#m        D      Bm      E
It's the final countdown...
               F#m        D      Bm      E
     The final countdown...                Ohhh,

[Verse]
F#m			                   Bm
    We're heading for Venus and still we stand tall
F#m				    E/G#     A
    Cause maybe they've seen us	and welcome us all
D              E
  With so many light years to go
A     E/G#         F#m     E     D
  and things to be found  (to be found)
                    C#m           E
I'm sure that we'll all miss her so.

[Chorus]

F#m  D  Bm  E
          F#m    E/G#  A  D    C#
The final countdown...      Oh-oh

[Chorus]
                F#m        D      Bm      E
It's the final countdown...
               F#m        D      Bm      E
     The final countdown...
               F#m            E/G#  A      D    C#
     The final countdown. The final countdown   Ohhh,
               F#m        D                 Bm     E
It's the final countdown.   We're leaving together
               F#m        D                    Bm   E
     The final countdown.   We'll all miss her so.
               F#m            E/G#  A      D   C#
It's the final countdown. The final countdown  Ohhh,
               F#m
It's the final countdown.
