[Verse 1]
          G                          C
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
            D                     G
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
            G                       C
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
D                           G
Knockin' me out with those American thighs
 
       G                        C
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,
    D                          G
She told me to come, but I was already there
           G                        C
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking
   D                    D
My mind was aching, and we were making it
 
[Chorus]
    G            C   G/B   D      C  G/B
And you shook me all night long
      G            C   G/B   D      C  G/B
Yeah, you shook me all night long
 
[Verse 2]
        G                    C
Working double time on the seduction line
        D                         G
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
       G                  C
Wanted no applause, just another course
       D                  G
Made a meal out of me and come back for more
 
       G                     C
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,
        D                         G
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing
           G                       C
'Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking
   D                    D
My mind was aching, and we were making it
 
[Chorus]
    G            C   G/B   D      C  G/B
And you shook me all night long
       G           C   G/B   D         C          G/B
Yeah, you shook me all night long  And knocked me out
       G            C   G/B   D      C            G/B
I said you shook me all night long     You had me shakin'
    G            C   G/B   D
and you shook me all night long
Dsus4                    D
      Yeah, you shook me
D
Well, you took me
