[Intro]
D Cadd9 G  x4
  
[Verse]
D     Cadd9          G
  Big wheels keep on turning
D          Cadd9          G
  Carry me home to see my kin
D         Cadd9           G
  Singing songs about the south land
D               Cadd9      G
  I miss 'ole' 'bamy once again and I think it's a sin
 
[Interlude]
D Cadd9 G
D Cadd9 G
 
[Verse]
  Well I heard Mr. Young sing about her
  Well I heard old Neil put her down
  Well I hope Neil Young will remember
  A southern man don’t need him around, anyhow
 
[Chorus]
D       Cadd9   G    D          Cadd9        G
  Sweet home Alabama, where the skies are so blue
D       Cadd9   G    D         Cadd9          G
  Sweet home Alabama, Lord I’m coming home to you 

[Verse]
In Birmingham they love the Gov'nor, boo-hoo-hoo
Now we all did what we could do
Now watergate does not bother me
Does you conscience bother you (tell the truth!)
  
[Chorus]
 
[Solo]

D Cadd9 G   D Cadd9 G   D Cadd9 G   D Cadd9 G  D Cadd9 G
  
[Verse]
Now Muscle Shoals has got the swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (yes we do)
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue, now how 'bout you?
  
[Chorus]
  
[Outro]
