   [Intro]
E       E7sus4  E  x8
 
   [Verse 1]
E                          E7sus4
Confidence is a preference for the habitual
E                           E7sus4
voyeur of what is known as (Parklife!)
    E                              E7sus4
And morning soup can be avoided if you take a route
E                                  E7sus4
straight through what is known as (Parklife!)
E                                   E7sus4
John's got brewers droop, he gets intimidated
       E                                     E7sus4
by the dirty pigeons, they love a bit of it (Parklife!)
E                                 E7sus4
Who's that gut lord marching? You should cut down
E                                E7sus4
on your pork life mate, get some exercise
 
   [Chorus]
E   Bb     B	  E  Bb      B
All the people	  So many people
          G  Bm Em      D
And they all go hand in hand
C       Em           Asus4 A  Bb  B7    D  C  B7      B7
Hand in hand through their    parklife		      Know what I mean?

   [Verse 2]
E                                  E7sus4
I get up when I want, except on Wednesdays
            E                              E7sus4
when I get rudely awakened by the dustmen (Parklife!)
  E                                 E7sus4
I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea
            E                       E7sus4
and I think about leaving me house (Parklife!)
E                               E7sus4
I feed the pigeons, I sometimes feed the sparrows too,
          E                                 E7sus4
it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (Parklife!)
E                                      E7sus4
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day,
                                 E                               E7sus4
safe in the knowledge there will always be a bit of my heart devoted to it
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
E  E7sus4  E	x4
 
E     A   E                 E7sus4	      E    A    E               E7sus4
It's got nothing to do with your(Parklife)    Vorsprung durch Technik, you know (Parklife!)
E   A    E                 E7sus4			       E     A   E
And it's not about you joggers who go 'round (Parklife!)   and round and round (Parklife!)
 
[Chorus x 2]
