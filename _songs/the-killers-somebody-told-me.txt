[Verse 1]
 
Bm
Breaking my back just to know your name,
                                           Em       G
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game.
Bm
I'm breaking my back just to know your name, 
But heaven ain't close in a place like this,
                                         Em        G
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss.
Bm
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this, 
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this.
G                   A                  Bm
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight,
G                                    A
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight.
 
[Chorus] 
               Bm	            G
Well, somebody told me,	 You had a boyfriend,
                   A	                     F#            Bm
Who looked like a girlfriend. That I had in February of last year,
          G		          A          F#
It's not confidential,	 I've got potential.
			  
[Verse 2]
Bm
Ready? Let's roll onto something new,
                                        Em     G
Taking it's toll and I'm leaving without you.
Bm
Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this,
 
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this.
G                   A                  Bm
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight,
G                                    A
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight.
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
 
Bm        A       G
Pace yourself for me,
       Bm    Em   G
I said maybe baby please.
                 Bm   A    G
But I just don't know now,
   F#                        A
When all I wanna do is try.
 
[Chorus] x3
