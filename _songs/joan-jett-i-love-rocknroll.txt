I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
  E                             B
I knew he musta been about seventeen
    A                B	  E                   A
The beat was going strong Playin' my favorite song
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long Till he was with me, yeah me
N.C.
An' I could tell it wouldn't be long
                 B
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'

I love rock n' roll  So come an' take your time an' dance with me

   E
He smiled so I got up an' asked for his name
E                                               B
That don't matter, he said, 'Cause it's all the same
A                   B	       E          A
Said can I take you home where we can be alone
An' next we were movin' on
He was with me, yeah me
N.C.
Next we were movin' on
            B
He was with me, yeah me, singin'

A                   B          E          A

An' singin' that same old song
Yeah with me, singin'
