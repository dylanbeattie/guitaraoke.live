Bm
Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
Asus4                          Gsus2            E7sus4  D A
Last night a little angel came pumpin' cross my floor
Bm
She said "Come on baby I got a licence for love
Asus4                  Gsus2           E7sus4 D A
And if it expires pray help from above  because
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bm
In the midnight hour she cried- "more, more, more"
Asus4                         Gsus2       E7sus4  D A
With a rebel yell she cried- "more, more, more"
Bm
In the midnight hour babe- "more, more, more"
Asus4               Gsus2       E7sus4  D     A     Bm
With a rebel yell- "more, more, more"   More, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
Asus4                                  Gsus2    E7sus4  D A
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
Bm
What set you free and brought you to me babe
Asus4                        Gsus2      E7sus4 D  A
What set you free I need you here by me  because
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bm
In the midnight hour she cried- "more, more, more"
Asus4                         Gsus2       E7sus4  D A
With a rebel yell she cried- "more, more, more"
Bm
In the midnight hour babe- "more, more, more"
Asus4               Gsus2       Bm
With a rebel yell- "more, more, more"

G    F#m    E
            He lives in his own heaven
G    F#m    E
            Collects it to go from the seven eleven
G    F#m    E
            Well he's out all night to collect a fare
G    F#m    Em7                                             D A Bm
            Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair

Bm
I walked the ward with you, babe
Asus4                 Gsus2   E7sus4  D A
A thousand miles with you
Bm
I dried your tears of pain, babe
Asus4               Gsus2   E7sus4  D A
A million times for you
 
Bm
I'd sell my soul for you babe
Asus4                  Gsus2   E7sus4  D A
For money to burn with you
Bm
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
      Asus4                            Gsus2     E7sus4
Justa, justa, justa, justa to have you here by me
