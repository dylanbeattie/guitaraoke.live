Intro: Ebm B Db 2x

[Verse 1] 
Gb                      Ebm
Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
     B			           Db
This world that I've found is too good to be true
Gb			   Ebm
Standing here beside you,  want so much to give you
     B                         Db
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you

[Prechorus]
Gb                        Ebm
  Let 'em say we're crazy,   I don't care about that
B				   Db
  Put your hand in my hand, baby,   don't ever look back
Gb                        Ebm
  Let the world around us  just fall apart
B                              E/Ab              Db
  Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart

[Chorus]
           Gb			      Ebm
And we can build this thing together, standing strong forever
B                       Db
Nothing's gonna stop us now
            Gb			      Ebm
And if this world runs out of lovers, we'll still have each other
B                        Db                       E/Ab   Db
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now
 
[Verse 2]
Gb			 Ebm
I'm so glad I found you	 I'm not gonna lose you
    B                    Db
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
Gb			   Ebm
Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
    B                     Db
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
 
[Prechorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gb    Bbm                B    Abm             Gb
Ooh, all that I need is you   All that I ever need
    Bbm                B      Abm               B              Db
And all that I want to do  Is hold you forever, ever and ever,

And if this world runs out of lovers  we'll still have each other
