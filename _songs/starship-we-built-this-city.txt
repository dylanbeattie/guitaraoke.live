[Verse 1]
F                         Bb/F
Say you don't know me, or recognize my face
Eb/F                    C7/F    F
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
F                        Bb/F
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight                                                            
Eb/F      C7/F     F                     C/E
Too many runaways   eating up the night
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Dm            Bb/D   Csus4              C            F     Bb
Mar-coni plays the mamba, listen to the radi-o, don't you remem-ber
   F          Bb    A5 G5        F          Bb       F    C/E Dm
We built this city,            we built this city on rock and  roll
 
[Chorus]
   Bb                   F/A               F    F/G F/A
We built this city, we built this city on rock and  roll
Bb                   F/A               C    Am  Bb
Built this city, we built this city on rock and  roll

[Verse 2]
F                        Bb/F
Someone's always playing corporation games
Eb/F                      C7/F     F
Who cares they're always changing   corporation names
F                           Bb/F
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
     Eb/F              C7/F   F                       C/E
They call us irrespon-sible,   write us off the page
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Dm            Bb/D   Csus4              C            F     Bb

   F          Bb    A5 G5        F          Bb       F    C/E Dm
We built this city,            we built this city on rock and  roll
 
[Chorus]
   Bb                   F/A               F    F/G F/A
We built this city, we built this city on rock and  roll
Bb                   F/A               C    Am Bb
Built this city, we built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday,                in a tired old street
Bb                   F           Bb         C/E F    Bb   F      Bb       C/E F
Police have got the choke hold,    oh-oh, oh,  oh,         but we just lost the  beat
 
[Verse 3]
F                    Bb/F
Who counts the money underneath the bar
Eb/F                    C7/F     F
Who rides the wrecking ball  in-to our guitars
      F                         Bb/F
Don't tell us you need us, 'cos we're [the ship of] fools
Eb/F           C7/F    F                              C/E
Looking for A-merica,  crawling through your schools
 
[Interlude]
Dm       Bb/D   F    Csus4   C            F     Bb
                                 don't you remem-ber
F          Bb    A5 G5        F          Bb       F   C/E Dm
