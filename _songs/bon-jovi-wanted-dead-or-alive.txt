[Verse]
D                   C                 G
It's all the same, only the names will change
C         G       F                  D
And ev'ry day, it seems we're wasting away
D               C                      G
Another place, where the faces are so cold
C             G            F           D
I'd drive all night, just to get back home
 
[Chorus]
C        G        F               D
I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
C         G  F       D
I'm wanted, dead or alive
C     G  F       D
Wanted, dead or alive
 
[Verse]
D                   C                     G
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
C             G           F                  D
and people I meet, always go their separate ways
D                            C                     G
Sometimes you tell the day, by the bottle that you drink
C                    G           F             D
And times when you're alone, and all you do is think
 
[Chorus]
 
[Solo]
  
[Verse]
D                          C                        G
And I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
C             G          F                   D
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
D                    C                 G
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
C                   G               F           D
I've seen a million faces, and I've rocked them all
 
[Chorus/Outro]
C                 G        F             D
'Cause I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
C         G           F       D
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
C               G             F           D
Well I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
C          G          F       D
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
C       G       C       G
Dead or alive, dead or alive
C       G        F         D
Dead or alive, I still ride  (still ride)
C       G       C       G
Dead or alive, Dead or alive
C       G       C       G
Dead or alive, dead or alive
C       G
Dead or alive, dead or alive
