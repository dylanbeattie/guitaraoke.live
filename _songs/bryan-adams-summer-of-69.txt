[Intro]
D

[Verse 1]
D				  A
   I got my first real six-string    Bought it at the five-and-dime
D				  A
   Played it 'til my fingers bled    It was the summer of '69
D				 A
   Me and some guys from school	    Had a band and we tried real hard
D				 A
   Jimmy quit, Jody got married	    I shoulda known we'd never get far

Bm             A	     D                         G
    Oh, when I look back now     That summer seemed to last forever
Bm           A		     D                    G
    And if I had the choice      Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life

(D)   A

D				A
    Ain't no use in complainin'	    When you got a job to do
D					   A
    Spent my evenin's down at the drive in     And that's when I met you, yeah
[Chorus 2]
Bm                   A		  D                          G
    Standin' on your mama's porch     You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm                   A		  D                      G
    Oh, and when you held my hand     I knew that it was now or never
Bm                 A               D
    Those were the best days of my life
(D)            A                               D       A
         Oh yeah        Back in the summer of '69     Ohhh

[Bridge]
F               Bb	              C
   Man, we were killin' time  We were young and restless
   Bb/D
We needed to unwind
F          Bb                  C
   I guess nothin' can last forever, forever no

[Instrumental]
D    A    x2

D				  A
   And now the times are changin'    Look at everything that's come and gone
D					     A
   Sometimes when I play that old six-string    I think about you, wonder what went wrong

[CHORUS]

[Outro]
