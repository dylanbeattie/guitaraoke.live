It's tough,  so tough.

For love, mmmm   for love.

She says we've got to hold on to what we've got.
   C              D                           Em
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not.
      C        D                  Em       C
We've got each other and that's a lot, for love.

We'll give it a shot.

Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear  Wo - oo, livin' on a prayer

[Verse 2]
Tommy's got his six-string in hock, now he's holding in, 
what he used to make it talk so tough,    mmm it's tough
Gina dreams of running away, when she cries in the night, Tommy whispers:
Baby, it's o-kay,    some day.
 
[Pre-chorus]
