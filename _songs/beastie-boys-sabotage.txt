It's A7. The entire song has one chord. A7.  Except in the chorus the bass plays a G under the A7.

[Verse 1]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage
 
[Instrumental break]
 
[Verse 2]
So, so, so, so listen up, 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on
 
 
[Verse 3]
Cause what you see, you might not get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Scheming on a thing, that's a mirage
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Whhhhhyyyyyy
(Our backs are now against the wall)
 
 
[Chorus]
A7                 A7/G
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
A7/F#               A7/G
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
A7                 A7/G
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
A7/F#               A7/G
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
 
 
[Verse 4]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be â€“ it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage
