[Verse]
Am                                                     G
   On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
                E                      F                        Am
They're made of lipstick, plastic, and paint, a touch of sable in your eyes
          Am                                                              G
(All your life) All your life all you've asked is when's your daddy gonna talk to you
         E                   F                   Am
You were living in another world trying to get a message through
 
E              G               Am
No one heard a single word you said
               Dm
They should've seen it in your eyes
         C                 G
What was going around your head
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am                     G
    Ooooh, she's a little runaway
   C                   Em    G                   Am
    Daddy's girl learned fast all those things he could'nt say
   G      E (x2)            Am
    Ooooh,   she's a little runaway
 
 
[Verse]
  Am                                          G
    A different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
   E                  F                      Am
    See you out in the streets, call me for a wild time
  Am                                                G
    So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
                E                    F                       Am
    There's only pictures hung in the shadows there for them to look at you
 
   E             G                              Am
    You know she likes the lights at night on the neon broadway sign
  Dm                                C                 G
    She don't really mind, it's only love she hopes to find
 
 
[Chorus]
  Am                     G
    Ooooh, she's a little runaway
   C                   Em    G           Am
    Daddy's girl learned fast all those he could'nt say
   G    E (x2)                      Am
    Ooooh,    she's a little runaway
 
 
   E              G              Am
    No one heard a single word you said
                 Dm
    They should've seen it in your eyes
            C                 G
    What was going around your head
 
 
    Oooh, she's a little runaway
