<p><strong>Guitaraoke is karaoke with real guitars.</strong> Singers sing along with live guitar players – and for guitar and bass players, we can mute the lead, rhythm, and bass guitar parts from any of the songs on the list so you can play them live.</p>

### Frequently Asked Questions

<dl>
    <dt>Can I see the words?</dt>
    <dd>Yes. Guitaraoke uses professional backing videos, and you'll have the words on screen.</dd>
    <dt>Can I see the guitar chords/tabs?</dt>
    <dd>No – sorry. You'll need to learn the songs.</dd>
    <dt>Do I have to sign up in advance?</dt>
    <dd>No. But if there's a song you particularly want to play or sing, <a href="#get-in-touch">get in touch</a> and I'll try to make it happen.</dd>
    <dt>Do I need to bring anything?</dt>
    <dd>Just your favourite plectrum. I'll provide instruments, backline, mics... all the things. (See the <a href="#gear-list">gear list</a> if you need to know what'll be there.</dd>
    <dt>I can just turn up and play? I don't need to lug my guitar along?</dt>
    <dd>Yes.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my guitar anyway?</dt>
    <dd>Sure. But it's at your own risk, and you might get to play only one or two songs. Also somebody else might ask if they can borrow it.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my favourite pedal?</dt>
    <dd>Yeah, but we won't have any time to soundcheck, so be prepared to plug in and play.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my amp?</dt>
    <dd>Please don't – we'll run everything through the venue PA.</dd>
    <dt>Can I bring my harmonica, saxophone, trombone, etc?</dt>
    <dd>Sure; if you're happy to jam along with whatever else is playing, go for it. We'll have a few extra microphones if you need one.</dd>
    <dt>What key is everything in?</dt>
    <dd>Tracks are the same as the original recording</dd>
    <dd><em>NOTE: Some bands (e.g. Guns 'n' Roses) tune everything down half a step in the studio. <strong>We don't</strong>. All the instruments are tuned to concert pitch, so songs like Beat It, Sweet Child O' Mine, etc, we play the same chords/shapes as the original but our version comes out in E rather than E♭.</em></dd>
    <dt>What if I drink four beers, get on stage believing I'm a rock god, and then realise I actually suck...?</dt>
    <dd>Relax. It's just for fun. But if you're really not enjoying yourself, give us the nod and we'll quietly fade you out and bring the original track back in and you can just jump around and pretend. (After all, that's what they do on Top Of The Pops.)</dd>

## Song List

If you want to play something that's not on the list, [get in touch](#get-in-touch) and I'll see what I can do.

{% include song-list.md %}

All the songs are also on a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0qIr80VVG38TWuQzs1Api6?si=b6b8a77fdfcf4ebe) so you can sing and jam along and get in the mood.

## Gear List

Here's what I'm bringing along. Feel free to bring your own guitar or pedals (but please leave your amp at home!)

- Fender Stratocaster electric guitar
- Ibanez RG570 electric guitar
- Steinberger Spirit GT3 electric guitar
- Peavey Millennium 5-string bass
- Walden D600 acoustic guitar
- Blackstar HT-5 valve amp
- Line6 Pod XT multi-FX
- Zoom G1On multi-FX
- 2 x Shure SM57 vocal mics
- 2 x Shure SM58 instrument mics

All running through a Behringer 16-channel desk into a full PA system with monitor wedges.

## How It Works

All the backing videos are mixed in 5.1 surround sound, using instrumental tracks and videos provided by [karaoke-version.co.uk](https://www.karaoke-version.co.uk/). The "backing" mix (drums, keyboards, strings, piano) are mixed on the back left and right channels, and each guitar is on a separate channel in the 5.1 mix - lead on the left, bass in the middle, rhythm on the right. The sound runs from the laptop into an Asus XONAR 5.1 audio interface, which gives isolated outputs for each track. Each track runs into a separate channel on the desk, so we can turn individual instruments on/off depending who's playing what on the night.

## Get in touch

I'm Dylan (hi!), and guitaraoke is a bit of an experiment. It's a format I've been tinkering with for _years_, and my birthday seemed like a great opportunity to make it happen.

If you want to request a song, or you're planning to come along and sing/play and have any questions, give me a shout - I'm [dylan@dylanbeattie.net](mailto:dylan@dylanbeattie.net) on email,
and [@dylanbeattie](https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie) on Twitter, and my website is at [dylanbeattie.net](https://dylanbeattie.net/).
