[Verse 1]
G              D		          Am7
Maybe, I don't really wanna know How your garden grows
       C            D
'Cause I just wanna fly
G               D		          Am7
Lately, did you ever feel the pain in the morning rain
      C                D
as it soaks it to the bone
 
[Chorus 1]
Em7                  D
  Maybe I just wanna fly
                           Am7
Wanna live I don't wanna die
                   C
Maybe I just wanna breathe
      D               Em7
Maybe I just don't believe
                         D
Maybe you're the same as me
                            Am7
We see things they'll never see
                            Fadd9
You and I are gonna live forever
 
[Verse 2]
       G             D		                Am7
I said maybe I don't really wanna know How your garden grows
      C              D
Cause I just want to fly
G               D		          Am7
Lately, did you ever feel the pain in the morning rain
      C                D
as it soaks it to the bone
 
[Chorus 2]
Em7                  D
  Maybe I will never be
                         Am7
all the things I want to be
                           C
but now is not the time to cry
          D                Em7
now`s the time to find out why.
                           D
I think you`re the same as me
                            Am7
we see things they`ll never see
                            Fadd9
you and I are gonna live forever.

Am7               Fadd9   Am7
Gonna live forever       gonna live forever
 
Am7       Fadd9        Am7        Fadd9       Am7
