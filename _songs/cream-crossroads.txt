A7	                      D7               A7
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
       D7                                      A7
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
E7                               D7                     A7
That sun up above for mercy, take me if you please


A7                             D7                  A7
I went down to the crossroads,   tried to flag a ride
       D7                                      A7
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
E7                        D7                     A7
Nobody seemed to know me, everybody passed me by


A7                               D7                      A7
Well I'm going down to Rosedale, take my 'Retta by my side
D7                                                       A7
Well I'm going down to Rosedale, take my 'Retta by my side
E7                              D7               A7
You can still buy her a house baby, on the riverside


A7                        D7                      A7
You can run, you can run, tell my friend old Willie Brown
D7                                        A7
Run, you can run, tell my friend old Willie Brown
E7                                   D7                  A7
That I'm standing at the crossroads, believe I'm sinking down
