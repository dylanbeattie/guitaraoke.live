[Verse 1]
 
Em
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell;
Em
Jimmy Rodgers on the Victrola up high.
Em
Mama's dancin', baby on her shoulders,
Em
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky.
B                               A
The boy could sing, knew how to move, everything;
G                   D
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                     D
Black velvet in that little boy's smile.
Am                         F   C
Black velvet in with that slow southern style.
Am                      D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees,
C      B              Em
Black velvet, if you please.
 
[Verse 2]
 
Em
Up in Memphis the music's like a heat wave,
Em
White lightnin', bound to drive you wild.
Em
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl,
Em
Love me tender, leaves 'em cryin' in the aisles.
B                         A
The way he moved it was a sin so sweet and true,
G                   D
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.

[Chorus]
 
[Break]
Am                   B                        Em
Every word of every song that he sang was for you.
Am                 F                   C
In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon.
B               Em
What could you dooooooooooo?
 
 
[Chorus]
