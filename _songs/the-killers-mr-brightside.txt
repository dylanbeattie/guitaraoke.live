[Intro]
D D/C#  G
 
[Verse 1]
D                   D/C#                           G
  Coming out of my cage  And I've been doing just fine   
  Gotta gotta be down because I want it all
D                       D/C#                          G
  It started out with a kiss How did it end up like this? 
  It was only a kissIt was only a kiss
D                   D/C#                      G
  Now I'm falling asleep And she's calling a cab    
  While he's having a smoke And she's taking the drag

D                      D/C#                     G
  Now they're going to bed   And my stomach is sick     			   
  And it's all in my head but she's touching his...

[Pre-Chorus]
Bm	                      A	              G
...chest now  He takes off her dress now Let me go

Bm		          A	         G
  I just can't look It's killing me And taking control 
 
[Chorus]
D	  G               Bm
Jealousy  Turning saints into the sea
A                      D
Swimming through sick lullabies
G               Bm
Choking on your alibis
A                  D
But it's just the price I pay
G          Bm
Destiny is calling me
A          D     Gmaj7
Open up my eager eyes
Bm                  A
   â€˜Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
