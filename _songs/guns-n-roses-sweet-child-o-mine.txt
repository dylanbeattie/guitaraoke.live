[Intro]
 
| D   | D   | C   | C   | G   | G   | D   | D   | x3
 
[Verse 1]
 D				        C
She's got a smile that it seems to me Reminds me of childhood memories
       G	                                  D
Where everything  Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D				     C
Now and then when I see her face She takes me away to that special place
         G		                                D
And if I stared too long  I'd probably break down and cry
 
[Chorus]
 A               C              D
Whoa oh, sweet child o' mine
A               C              D
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine
 
[Solo 1]
 
| D   | D   | C   | C   | G   | G   | D   | D   |
 
[Verse 2]
D				       C
She's got eyes of the bluest skies  As if they thought of rain
    G				      D
I'd hate to look into those eyes  And see an ounce of pain
    D					       C
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place Where as a child I'd hide
    G				        D
And pray for the thunder and rain  To quietly pass me by
 
[Chorus]
