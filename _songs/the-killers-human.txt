[Verse 1]
  B              D#m             E                  B
I did my best to notice when the call came down the line.
          F#              G#m          E                  F#
Up to the platform of surrender I was brought, but I was kind.
    B               D#m            E           G#m
And sometimes I get nervous when I see an open door.
           E                E         F#         F#
Close your eyes, clear your heart.
 
[Chorus 1]
        B             D#m   E           B
Cut the cord - are we human,  or are we dancer?
F#            G#m   E              F#
  My sign is vital,  my hands are cold.
        B     D#m                   G#m      G#m
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer.
       C#m    E           B        B
Are we human,  or are we dancer?

[Verse 2]
          B                  D#m                E           B
Pay my respects to grace and virtue, send my condolences to good.
          F#                 G#m                  E                 F#
Give my regards to soul and romance, they always did the best they could.
    B            D#m                   E            G#m
And so long to devotion, you taught me everything I know.
         E            E         F#         F#
Wave goodbye, wish me well.
 
[Chorus 2]

[Middle Eight]
          E           F#               Gdim            G#m
Will your system be alright, when you dream of home tonight?
      E             E                F#                   F#
There is no message we're receiving, let me know is your heart still beating?

Are we human,  or are we dancer?
       E     C#m           B        B
Are we human,  or are we dancer?
