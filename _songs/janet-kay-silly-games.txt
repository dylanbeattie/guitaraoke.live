I've been wanting you	   For so long, it's a shame		Oh, baby

Every time I hear your name Oh, the pain  Boy, how it hurts me inside
 
[Verse 2]
F
'Cause every time we meet
Am
We play hide and seek
                     F      Bb
I'm wondering what I should do
                     Bbm
Should I, dear, come up to you
          F
And say, "how do you do?"
C7            Gm7 C
Would you turn me away?
 
[Chorus]
Ab			Cm
You're as much to blame	'Cause I know you feel the same
C              Dm
I can see it in your eyes
Bb              C      F         Dm
But I've got no time to live this lie
Bb           C                            Fm7  Fm  Bb
No, I've got no time to play your silly ga----------mes

Yet, in my mind I say "If he makes his move today  I'll just pretend to be shocked"
       Bbm		F		 C             G  C
Oh baby,it's a tragedy	That you and me	 We don't even tryy
 
[Chorus]

You're as much to blame
