[Verse 1]
A A A          D/F# D/F# G            D/F# D/F# G
      Livin' easy,         livin' free
D/F# D/F# G    D/F#   A A
     Season ticket on a one way ride
A A A          D/F# D/F# G            D/F# D/F# G
      Askin' nothin',      leave me be
D/F# D/F# G  D/F#  A A
   Takin' everythin' in my stride

A A A               D/F# D/F# G                D/F# D/F# G
      Don't need reason,        don't need rhyme
D/F# D/F# G  D/F#     A A
    Ain't nothin' I'd rather do
A A A         D/F# D/F# G           D/F# D/F# G
      Goin' down,         party time
D/F# D/F# G      D/F#      E
      My friends are gonna be there too

[Chorus]
           A   A   A  D/A      G
I'm on the highway to hell
    D/F#   A   A   A  D/A      G
    On the highway to hell
    D/F#   A   A   A  D/A      G
           Highway to hell
    D/F#   A   A   A  D/A
I'm on the highway to hell

[Verse 2]
A A A         D/F# D/F# G           D/F# D/F# G
      No stop signs,      speed limit
D/F# D/F# G     D/F#  A A
       Nobody's gonna slow me down
A A A           D/F# D/F# G              D/F# D/F# G
      Like a wheel,         gonna spin it
D/F# D/F# G    D/F# A A
       Nobody's gonna mess me around

A A A         D/F# D/F# G             D/F# D/F# G
      Hey Satan,          payin' my dues
D/F# D/F# G      D/F# A A
           Playin' in a rockin' band
A A A        D/F# D/F# G          D/F# D/F# G
      Hey mama,          look at me
D/F# D/F# G    D/F#     E
   I'm on my way to the promised land

[Chorus]
