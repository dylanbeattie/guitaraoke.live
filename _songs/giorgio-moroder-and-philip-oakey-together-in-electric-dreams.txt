I only knew you for a while   I never saw your smile

Time to go away (time to go away)

Sometimes it's hard to recognize   Love comes as a surprise

Too late to stay

No matter where I go I`ll never find a better prize

                         Bb	     Cm             Ab                  Eb
Though you're miles and miles away I see you every day I don't have to try

I just close my eyes, I close my eyes
