E
Out where the river broke, the bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels, steam in forty five degrees
 
[Pre-chorus]
    E                            D
The time has come, to say fair's fair;
   A                E
to pay the rent, to pay our share
    E                         D
The time has come, a fact's a fact;
     A                    F#
it belongs to them, let's give it back
 
E G A
 
[Chorus] 
Em                        C                G
How can we dance when our earth is turning?
Em                        C                D
How do we sleep while our beds are burning?
Em                        C                G
How can we dance when our earth is turning?
Em                        C                D
How do we sleep while our beds are burning?
 
    Em               C
The time has come to say fairs fair,
   G                    D
to pay the rent, now to pay our share
 
E
Four wheels scare the cockatoos, from Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes, in forty five degrees
