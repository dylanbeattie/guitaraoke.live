[Verse 1]
          Dm                       C              Bb       A
You get a shiver in the dark, it's raining in the park but meantime
Dm                        C            Bb         A
  South of the river you stop and you hold everything
F                                 C
  A band is blowing Dixie double four time
Bb                                            Dm    Bb - C
   You feel alright when you hear that music ring
 
[Verse 2]
              Dm                  C         Bb        A
Well now, you step inside but you don't see too many faces
Dm                      C                Bb      A
   Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
F                       C
  Competition in other places
Bb                                     Dm
   Uh, but the horns they blowin' that sound
Bb - C
        way on down south
Bb - C
        way on down south
Dm
London Town
