A man walks down the street, he says why am I soft in the middle now,

why am I soft in the middle, the rest of my life is so hard,
F          C		     Bb                   C
I need a photo-opportunity,  I want a shot at redemption,

Bonedigger, bonedigger,	  dogs in the moonlight,

Mr. Beerbelly, Beerbelly, get these mutts away from me,

If you'll be my bodyguard I can be your long lost pal,

I can call you Betty, and Betty when you call me
         F          C Bb C
you can call me Al.

[Verse]
A man walks down the street, he says why am I short of attention,
got a short little span of attention, and wo my nights are so long,
wheres my wife and family,  what if I die here,
wholl be my role-model,	now that my role-model is gone, gone,
He ducked back down the alley with some roly-poly little bat-faced girl,
All along, along  there were incidents and accidents,
there were hints and allegations.

[Chorus]

[Solo]
F Bb C F Bb F   8x

[Verse]
A man walks down the street, its a street in a strange world,
maybe its the Third World, maybe its his first time around,
he doesnt speak the language, he holds no currency,
he is a foreign man, he is surrounded by
the sound, the sound,cattle in the marketplace,
scatterlings and orphanages,
he looks around, around, he sees angels in the architecture,
spinning in infinity,  he says Amen and Hallelujah!

[Chorus]
