[Intro]

E7b9

[Verse]
   Am                        Dm
At first I was afraid, I was petrified,
              G                              Cmaj7
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side.
           Fmaj7                          Bm7b5
But then I spent so many nights, thinking how you did me wrong,
           Esus4                 E
And I grew strong; and I learned how to get along.

               Am               Dm
But now you're back, from outer space,
              G                                   Cmaj7
I just walked in, to find you here, with that sad look upon your face.
              Fmaj7
I should have changed that stupid lock,
              Bm7b5
I should have made you leave your key,
         Esus4                               E
If I had known for just one second, you'd be back to bother me.

[Chorus]
           Am               Dm
Go on now, go; walk out the door;
            G                          Cmaj7
Just turn a-round now, 'cos you're not welcome any more.
Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
 Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
                  Esus4                      E
Did you think I'd crumble; did you think I'd lay down and die?
           Am            Dm
Oh no, not I; I will sur-vive,
       G                             Cmaj7
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive.
         Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give,
             Esus4            E                Am
And I'll sur-vive, I will sur-vive, I will sur-vive...

[Interlude]
Am  Dm  G  Cmaj7  Fmaj7  Bm7b5  Esus4  E

[Verse]
         Am                                 Dm
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart.
               G                             Cmaj7
Kept trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.
            Fmaj7                            Bm7b5
And I spent oh, so many nights, just feeling sorry for myself,
          Esus4          E7
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high.
            Am           Dm
And you see me; somebody new,
             G                                  Cmaj7
I'm not that chained up little person, still in love with you.
           Fmaj7                             Bm7b5
And so you felt like dropping in and just ex-pect me to be free,
              Esus4                          E
Well, now I'm saving all my loving, for some-one who's loving me.

Go on now, go; walk out the door;

Just turn a-round now, 'cos you're not welcome any more...
