[Verse 1] (Intro riff played throughout verse)
 
               F
Well we were born within an hour of each other
 
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
              A#
Your name is Deborah, Deborah - it never suited you
          F
And they said that when we grew up
 
We'd get married and never split up
            A#
Oh we never did, although I often thought of it
 
 
[Bridge]

Oh Deborah, do you recall?
 
Your house was very small
 
With woodchip on the wall
 
And when I came round to call
                       F
You didn't notice me at alllllllll
  
[Chorus]
 
              A#
And I said, let's all meet up in the year 2000
Dm                                        Gm
won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
                            Cm               F
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
A#
I never knew that you'd get married
Dm
I would be living down here on my own
         Gm                Cm              F
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago
  
[Verse 2] (Intro riff played throughout verse)
 
You were the first girl in school to get breasts
Martin said that you were the best
Oh the boys all loved you, but I was a mess
I had to watch 'em try to get you undressed
We were friends that was as far as it went
I used to walk you home sometimes but it meant
Oh it meant nothing to you
cos you were, oh so popular
  
[Bridge]
 
[Chorus]
 
[Middle Eight] (Spoken over intro riff)
 
Do it, oh yeah, oh yeah. And now it's all over. You've paid your money
and you've taken your choice and I know we'll never meet again.
But Deborah, I just wanted you to know I remember every single thing.
