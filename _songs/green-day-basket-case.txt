[Verse 1]
 
E               B        C#m           G#m
Do you have the time  To listen to me whine
 A                E	           B
About nothing and everything   All at once
E           B	       C#m         G#m
I am one of those    Melodramatic fools
   A            E                    B
Neurotic to the bone  No doubt about it


 
 
[Chorus]
 
A             B             E
  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
A              B                  E
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   A                B	   E         D        C#m
It all keeps adding up	 I think I'm cracking up
   A          B	                (E)
Am I just paranoid?   Am I just stoned?
 
[Riff]
 
E  B  C#m B	X4
 
[Verse 2]
 
  E         B	      C#m         G#m
I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams
    A                 E	                   B
She says it's lack of sex  That's bringing me down
  E         B	       C#m               G#m
I went to a whore   She said my life's a bore
   A               E	               B
So quit my whining cause It's bringing her down

[Chorus]
 
[Riff]
 
 
[Bridge]
 
A              B
Grasping to control
N.C.         E
So I better hold on
