[Verse]
    Cm7      Bb        Cm7	                     Bb           Cm7
The power of love is a curious thing  make a one man weep, make another man sing
         Bb        Cm7		                  Bb      Cm7
Change a hawk to a little white dove  more than a feeling    that's the power of love

| F  Gm7 |
 
Tougher than diamonds, bricks like cream / Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
make a bad one good make a wrong one right / power of love that keeps you home at night
 
[Chorus]
C               C/E    F           G   	C              C/E            F         G
 You don't need money,  don't take fame	 Don't need no credit card to ride this train
     C               C/E               F          G         Bb         F         Gsus4
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes but it might just save your life
G                     Cm7	  F                     Cm7
 That's the power of love	   That's the power of love

F Bb F
  
[Verse]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad / Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found / that's the power makes the world go'round
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
Eb              G7               Cm7            Cm7/F     F
  They say that all in love is fair   yeah, but you don't care
Ab             Eb/G	  Fm7             Eb
  But you know what to do    when it gets hold of you
Ab                 Gsus4	    G                       Cm7
  and with a little help from above  you feel the power of love
F                       Cm7
 you feel the power of love
F
 Can you feel it ?
Cm7     F Cm7 Bb
 
[Chorus + Outro]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
C          C/E         F            G
 you won't feel nothin' till you feel
C               C/E F           Gsus4
 you feel the power, just the power of love
C             C/E F             Gsus4      C
 That's the power, that's the power of love
F             G
 You feel the power of love
