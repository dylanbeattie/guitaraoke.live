[Intro]
 D  E                 D  Em    C     D       D    E    D   Em  C D
     Hey hey hey hey!        Oooooooooooooh, oh...oh
 
[Verse 1]
 E               D             A             D
  Won't you come see about me? I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby.
 E             D                    A                    D
  Tell me your troubles and doubts, giving me everything inside and out, and out.
 E                   D                 A                          D
  Love's strange, so real in the dark, think of the tender things that we were working on
 E                D              A                   D
  Slow change may pull us apart, when the light gets into your heart, baby
 
[Chorus]
 E          D               A    D
  Don't you... forget about me,  don't, don't, don't, don't.
 E          D               A    A
  Don't you... forget about me.
 
[Bridge]
C                        G
Will you stand above me, look my way, never love me?
D                                      A
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down, down, down.
C                      G
Will you recognize me, call my name or walk on by?
D                                      A
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling down, down, down, down
 
[Interlude]
 D  E                 D  Em    C     D       D    E
     Hey hey hey hey!        Oooooooooooooh, oh...oh

[Verse 2]
 E          D               A                     D
  Don't you try to pretend, it's my feeling we'll win in the end. I won't
 E            D                    A            D
  harm you or touch your defences; vanity and security.
 E             D             A             D
  Don't you forget about me, I'll be alone dancing, you know it, baby.
 E         D               A                  D
  Going to take you apart, I'll put us back together at heart, baby.
 
[Chorus]
 
[Coda]
               E    D                  A      D
As you walk on by...  will you call my name?
               E    D                  A      D
As you walk on by...  will you call my name?
               E    D   A   D	                   E    D   A   D
When you walk away.		 Or will you walk away?
                 E    D   A                 D	    E                 D    A   
Will you walk on by?       Come on, call my name.    Will you call my name?
 D
[Outro]
       E           D               A               D
I say, la la la la la...  la la la la...  la la la la la la la la la...
E           D               A               D
la la la la la...  la la la la...  la la la la la la la la la...
