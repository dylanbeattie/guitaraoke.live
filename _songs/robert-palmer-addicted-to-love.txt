Guitar:
    A                 G              D             A
 
[Verse 1]
                A                 A	     G                 G
The lights are on, but you're not home	Your mind, is not your own
           D                 D	             A                A
Your heart sweats, your body shakes  Another kiss, is what it takes
 
[Verse 2]
          A                A	           G                 G
You can't sleep, you can't eat	There's no doubt, you're in deep
               D                  D	         A               A
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe	 Another kiss is all you need
 
[Chorus]
      F#m                             D                     A
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah!
F#m                            D
Closer to the truth to say you can't get enough 
           D5            Dsus2          D               D5 D5
And you're gonna have to face it you're addicted to love
 
[Verse 3]
You see the signs, but you can't read You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats, in double time Another kiss and you'll be mine
 
[Verse 4]
A one-track mind, you can't be saved Oblivion, is all you crave
If there's some left for you You don't mind if you do
 
[Chorus]
 
[Bridge]
A
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
G
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
D
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
A
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
N.C.
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love
 
[Solo]
[Verse 5]
The lights are on, but you're not home Your will, is not your own
Your heart sweats, your teeth grind Another kiss and you'll be mine
 
[Chorus]
 
[Outro = repeat bridge]
