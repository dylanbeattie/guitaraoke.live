[Intro]
B  F#m  E	B  F#m  E
 
[Verse]
B                       F#m	 E
Run and tell all of the angels	 This could take all night
B                       F#m                 E
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
B                    F#m            E
Hook me up a new revolution    Cause this one is a lie
   B                        F#m                    E
We sat around laughing, and watching the last one die
 
[Chorus]
    B                     F#m	   E
I'm looking to the sky to save me  Looking for a sign of life
B                        F#m              E
Looking for something to help me burn out bright
B                      F#m	E
I'm looking for a complication	Looking 'cause I'm tired of lying
G                A                 B
Make my way back home and learn to fly
 
[Instrumental]
B  F#m   E	B  F#m   E
 
[Verse]
B                      F#m	  E
Think I'm dying nursing patience, It could wait one night.
B                        F#m              E
Give it all away if you give me one last try
B               F#m             E
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life.
B                            F#m               E
Run and tell the angels that everything's alright.
 
[Chorus]
    B                      F#m	    E
I'm looking to the sky to save me,  Looking for a sign of life.
B                        F#m             E
Looking for something to help me burnout bright.
    B                  F#m	E
I'm looking for a complication,	Looking 'cause I'm tired of trying.
G                A                    E
Make my way back home when I learn to fly.
G                A                    B
Make my way back home when I learn to fly....
 
[Bridge]
    G               D                   E
....along with me I can't quite make it alone.
G                A
Try to make this life my own.
B       G               D                   E
Fly.....along with me I can't quite make it alone.
G                 A
Try to make this life my own.
 
[Chorus X 2 (well, actually x 1.9, 'cos the first one jumps into the second one early]
