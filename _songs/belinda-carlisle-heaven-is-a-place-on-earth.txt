[Chorus]
C#m   A             B                C#m
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?
 E    A            B      C#m
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth.
     C#m     A      B          C#m
They say in Heaven love comes first,
 E          A         B      C#m
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth,
 E    A            B      C#m
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth.

[Verse]
          E           B
When the night falls down,
   A                     B
I wait for you, and you come around,
         E        B
And the world's alive
          A                      B
With the sound of kids on the street outside.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                   A
   When you walk into the room
G                             A
   You pull me close and we start to move,
F#m                              G
   And we're spinning with the stars above,
            Em   F#m        G       A
   And you lift me up in a wave of love.
 
 
[Chorus]
C#m   A             B                C#m
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth?

Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth.
     C#m     A      B          C#m
They say in Heaven love comes first,
 E          A         B      C#m
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth,
 E    A            B      C#m
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth.
 
 
[Verse]
        E     B
When I feel alone
   A                       B
I reach for you, and you bring me home.
          E       B
When I'm lost at sea
   A                      B
I hear your voice and it carries me.
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
G                       A
   In this world we're just beginning
G                     A
   To understand the miracle of living.
F#m               G
   Baby, I was afraid before
           Em    F#m  G   A
   But I'm not afraid anymore.

Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth.
     C#m     A      B          C#m
They say in Heaven love comes first,
 E          A         B      C#m
We'll make Heaven a place on Earth,
 E    A            B      E
Ooh, Heaven is a place on Earth.
