[Verse]
 
[ E ]                     Bm	  D                 F#m
   Like the legend of the phoenix   All ends with beginnings
E                       Bm	  D                      F#m      
  What keeps the planet spinning    The force from the beginning
  E
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
Bm             D
We've come too far
        F#m        E
To give up who we are
   Bm              D
So let's raise the bar
        F#m          E
And our cups to the stars
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Bm                               D
 She's up all night till the sun   I'm up all night to get some
F#m                              E
 She's up all night for good fun   I'm up all night to get lucky

Bm                               D
 We're up all night till the sun    We're up all night to get some
F#m                              E
 We're up all night for good fun    We're up all night to get lucky

 
Bm                                D
 We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky
F#m                               E
 We're up all night to get lucky   We're up all night to get lucky

| Bm | D | F#m | E |


[ E ]                 Bm	D                    F#m
   The present has no ribbon	  Your gift keeps on giving
E                  Bm	       D                           F#m     
  What is this I'm feeling?      If you want to leave, I'm with it 
   E
