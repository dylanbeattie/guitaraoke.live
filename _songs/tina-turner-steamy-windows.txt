[Intro]
E
 
[Verse]
      E
I was thinking about parking the other night
G        A           E
  We was out on the back road
E
Me and my baby was just getting right
    G          A    E
All systems on overload
E
Radio blasting in the front seat
G               A       E
Turning out the music fine
    E
And we were snuggled up in the back seat
G             A      E
Making up for lost time
 
[Chorus]
               E     D      A   E
Steamy windows	   Zero visibility
              E	   D               A     E
Steamy windows	   Coming from the body heat

[Verse]
        E
You can wine and dine with a man all night
G       A      E
   With good intent
             E
But there is something about a confrontation on the back road
G         A          E
   Breaks down the defense
 
[Chorus]
               E      D      A   E
Steamy windows	    Zero visibility
              E	   D               A     E
Steamy windows	   Coming from the body heat
               E     D       A         E
Steamy windows	  It ain't nobody can see
               E  D               A     E
Steamy windows	  Coming from the body heat
 
[Interlude]
E /  G   A   E / G   A   E
 
[Verse]
          E
There's a sound outside the front door
      G         A         E
And I know it's just the wind
       E
But it makes him snuggle up just a little bit closer
    G            A          E
And start things happening again, yeah, yeah, yeah
  
[Chorus]
[Outro]
