[Verse]
C
She came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge
She studies sculpture at St. Martins College
             G
That's where I caught her eye
C
  She told me that her dad was loaded
I said "In that case, I'll have a rum and coca-cola"
                  G
She said "fine" and in a thirty seconds time she said

[Chorus]
F				                                          
 "I want to live like common people I want to do whatever common people do
C 				                                                
  I want to sleep with common people I want to sleep with common people like you"
G                                                              C
  Well, what else could I do? I said "I'll see what I can do"

[Verse]
C
  I took her to a supermarket
                                                                G
I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere - so it started there
C
I said "Pretend you've got no money" She just laughed and said "Oh, you're so funny"
             G
I said "Yeah, well I can't see someone else smiling in here... are you sure?"

[Chorus]
F				                                            C
  you want to live like common people You want to see whatever common people see
				                                                  G
You want to sleep with common people You want to sleep with common people like me"
                                                            C
But she didn't understand, she just smiled and held my hand

[Bridge]
             C
Rent a flat above your shop, cut your hair and get a job
                        G
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school
                           C
But still, you'll never get it right, 'cos when you're laid in bed at night
                     G
watching roaches climb the wall, if you called your dad he could stop it all

[Chorus]
F				                                               C
You'll never live like common people You'll never do whatever common people do
				                                                     G
You'll never fail like common people  You'll never watch your life slide out of view
                                                                 C
And dance and drink and screw because there's nothing else to do

[Chorus]
F				                                            C
Sing along with the common people,Sing along and it might just get you thru
				                                                    G
Laugh along with the common people Laugh along even though they are laughing at you
				                                      C
And the stupid things that you do Because you think that poor is cool

[Verse]
C
Like a dog lying in a corner, they will bite you and never warn you
         G
look out, they'll tear your insides out
C
'Cos everybody hates a tourist especially one who thinks that it's all
               G
Such a laugh
and the chip stains and grease will come out in the bath
               F
you will never understand how it feels to live your life
                    C
With no meaning or control and with nowhere left to go
                  G
You are amazed that they exist and they burn so bright
                                              C
Whilst you can only wonder why

[Bridge]
             C
Rent a flat above your shop, cut your hair and get a job
                        G
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school
                           C
But still, you'll never get it right, 'cos when you're laid in bed at night
                     G
watching roaches climb the wall, if you called your dad he could stop it all

[Chorus]
F				                                                 C
You'll never live like common people   You'll never do whatever common people do
				                                                    G
You'll never fail like common people You'll never watch your life slide out of view
                                                                 C
And dance and drink and screw because there's nothing else to do
I want to live with common people like you
I want to live with common people like you
