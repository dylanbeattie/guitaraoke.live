[Intro]
Am E Dm Am
Am E Dm Am
 
 
[Verse 1]
Am               E7	         Dm          Am
It's buggin' me, grating me  and twisting me around
                  E7	         Dm             Am
yes I'm endlessly caving in  and turnin' inside out
 
[Chorus]
                 C              G7
'cause I want it now  I want it now
Dm                           Am
  give me your heart and your soul
                C                G7
and I'm breakin out    I'm breakin out
Dm                   E7
 last chance to lose control
 
[Interlude]
Am E Dm Am
 
[Verse 2]
                 E7	           Dm              Am
It's holdin' me, morphin' me   and forcin' me to strive
                E7	        Dm           Am
to be endlessly cold within and dreaming I'm alive
 
[Chorus]
 
[Interlude]
E  (4 measures)
 
[Solo]
Am E Dm Am	Am E Dm Am
C G Dm Am	C G Dm Am
 
[Chorus]
               C               G7   Dm
and I want you now   I want you now
               Am
I feel my heart implode
           C	               G7
I'm breakin' out       escaping now
Dm              E7
feelin' my faith erode
 
[Outro]
E   (4 measures)
