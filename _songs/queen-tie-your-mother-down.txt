A (hammer on & off C )			                                            G-D-C-G/B
Got my timin' right, got my act all tight It's gotta be tonight my little schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't, and your daddy says you won't
         		           G                       A       A-B-C-C#-D

You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house
                               G-D-C-G/B

E
But you know I don't give a light, I've got a sweetheart hand
                     G                       A     A-B-C-C#-D
