[Verse 1]
    G         D           Am             C
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me 
  G                  D           Am   C
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed 
        G             D             Am
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her 
C            G            D         Am       C
Thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead 
 
         G                           D
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming 
Am                     C
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running 
G                        D
Didn't make sense not to live for fun 
     Am                        C
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb 
 
G             D
So much to do so much to see 
          Am                    C
So what's wrong with taking the back streets 
       G                       D
You'll never know if you don't go 
       Am                       C
You'll never shine if you don't glow 
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold 
 
[Verse 2]
       G                   D
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder 
       Am                       C
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older 
        G                 D
But the meteor men beg to differ 
               Am                    C
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture 
 
           G                       D
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin 
                   Am                        C
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim 
              G              D
My world's on fire how about yours 
                 Am                      C
That's the way I like it and I never get bored 
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
G        C           C#dim
all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold 
 
[Instrumental]
G  C  C#dim  C  x4
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
     G       C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G    F
Only shooting stars
 
[Verse 3]
    G         D              Am                    C
Somebody once asked, could I spare some change for gas 
          G           D             Am    C
I need to get myself away from this place
       G             D            Am                  C
I said yep what a concept I could use a little fuel myself 
             G         D      Am       C
And we could all use a little change 
 
         G                           D
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming 
Am                     C
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running 
G                        D
Didn't make sense not to live for fun 
     Am                        C
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb 
 
G             D
So much to do so much to see 
          Am                    C
So what's wrong with taking the back streets 
       G                       D
You'll never know if you don't go, go 
       Am                       C
You'll never shine if you don't glow 
 
[Chorus]
G                 C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play 
G                C                 C#dim      C
Hey now you're a Rock Star get the show on get paid 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold 
    G        C           C#dim
And all that glitters is gold 
C             G     F         C
Only shooting stars break the mold
