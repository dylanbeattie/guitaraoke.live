[Intro]
 
Em7			    A7
Is this the real life	    Is this just fantasy
D7          Am7 D7	      G
Caught in a landslide	  No escape from reality
Em			       G7                   C
Open your eyes		  Look up to the skies and see

Am                   D7
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
            G#   G     F#   G	  G#     G     F#     G
Because I'm easy come, easy go,	  little high, little low,
C           G/B         Bbdim7         D7/A
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me,
   G
To me
 
[Verse]
G          Em
Mama, just killed a man,
      Am		              Am                 D
Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
G              Em
Mama, life had just begun,
    Am                Am/G#     Am/G Am/F#   Am/F Am/E
But now I've gone and thrown it all  away
C    G Am            Dm
Mama ooooh,   Didn't mean to make you cry
   G                               C
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
      G         Am        Fm                C
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
 
G
 
[Verse]
G            Em
Too late, my time has come,
      Am		            Am               D
Sends shivers down my spine  Body's aching all the time,
G                        Em
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
      Am              Am/G#    Am/G Am/F#    Am/F Am/E
Gotta leave you all behind and face   the truth
C    G Am
Mama ooooh (any way the wind blows)
Dm		       G                                      C
I don't want to die, I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
