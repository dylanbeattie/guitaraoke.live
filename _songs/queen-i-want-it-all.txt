[Intro]

I want it all, I want it all,
I want it all, and I want it now.

[Verse 1] 
Bm                 G
Adventure seeker on an empty street,
A                     Bm    A
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet,
 Bm                          G
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
       A                     Bm   A
With the pain and the anger can't see a way out,
   D                   A
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
G               A                     G
Gotta find me a future move out of my way, 

[Chorus]
Bm             G              A                  Bm     A
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now.
Bm             G              A                  Bm     A
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now.

[Verse 2]
Bm                  G
Listen all you people, come gather round,
  A                      Bm                 A
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground,
Bm                     G
Just give me what I know is mine,
A             Bm                A
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
   D                       A
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
G             A                        G
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
B
I'm a man with a one track mind,
E                F#
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)
B			      E                     F#
No time for compromise and  where's and why's and living lies
G
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
A
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,

[Solo] 
Bm G A E 
Bm G A G A 
   D              G        A
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
G             A                       G
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,

[Chorus]
