[Verse 1]
          Em            G C B
I'm gonna fight 'em off
               Em            G       C    B
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
              Em         G C B
They're gonna rip it off
             Em           G       C    B
Taking their time right behind my back
        Em           G       C	              B        Em  G C B
And I'm talking to myself at night  Because I can't forget
Em             G          C             B   Em    G C B
Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigarette
      G                      A
And a message coming from my eyes says leave it alone
 
[Instrumental]
Em G C B x4
Am B E
 
[Verse 2]
          Em            G C B
Don't want to hear about it
               Em            G       C    B
Every single one's got a story to tell
          Em            G C B
Everyone knows about it
               Em            G       C    B
From the Queen of England to the hounds of Hell
          Em            G C B
And if I catch it coming back my way
               Em            G       C    B
I'm gonna serve it to you
          Em            G C B
And that ain't what you want to hear
               Em            G       C    B
But that's what I'll do
      G                      A
And a feeling coming from my bones says find a home
 
[Verse 3]
          Em            G C B
I'm going to Wichita
               Em            G       C    B
Far from this opera, forever more
          Em            G C B
I'm going to work the straw
               Em            G       C    B
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
          Em            G C B
And I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding and I'm bleeding
               Em            G       C    B
Right before the Lord
          Em            G C B
All the words are going to bleed from me
               Em            G       C    B
And I will think no more
        G                     A
And the stains coming from my blood tell me go back home
